#    Number Guessing
#
#    Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
#    Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
#    Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses
